<h1>Sales Forecasting for Retail<h1>

<h5>Sales forecasting is the process of estimating future sales. Accurate sales forecasts enable companies to make informed business decisions and predict short-term 
and long-term performance. Companies can base their forecasts on past sales data, industry-wide comparisons, and economic trends.

Our analysis can be used to :-

1. To predict and plan the inventory throughout the year
    An accurate sales forecast allows you to properly plan for impending sales. If you have developed an understanding of how your business' sales naturally 
    increase and decrease over the year, you can plan by -Keeping appropriate levels of stock.

2. Helps to manage staff and other resources
    In retail, the holiday season typically influences a sharp increase in sales and to prepare for that stores ensure they have more stock than normal, and they 
    hire a seasonal workforce to support the demand. Predicting sales beforehand gives a detailed idea for the retail stores as to how much extra workforce is 
    required and how to manage resources efficiently.
    
3. Predict achievable sales revenue and in turn make wise business investments
    Accurate sales forecasting allows you to predict the funds you have coming in against your anticipated costs. These forecasts allow you to understand when you will 
    have the funds available to wisely invest in growth without sacrificing much needed capital for your day-to-day business expenses.<h5>
    
    
    <h2>Source of Data</h2>
    
<h5>The data contains historic sales data from the clientâ€™s database. It was found on Kaggle. We have data ranging from the year 2010 to the year 2013. 
    This data contains anonymized information for 45 stores in different locations. It contains important data columns such as sales, discounts, size of the stores, 
    CPI, fuel price etc.The data can be found at this link https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset  </h5>
      
    
  <h5>Modeling :- The end goal of this project is to predict sales for next 12 months. For predictions, regression models serve best. So, I decided to use Random Forest Regression and Linear Regression. But here we are not just predicting the sales. We are also predicting how sales change over a period of time. Since the data also consists of successive measurements over a time interval, which also displays seasonality, I have implemented Time Series Forecasting as well.</h5>
